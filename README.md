# LFI Specification

This directory holds the Latex source files for the specification of trusted
LFI components: the verifier and the runtime. A PDF version of this
specification can be found
[online](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~zyedidia/docs/lfi/lfi-spec.pdf).

# Status

This specification should be considered a draft. However, it is the most
up-to-date documentation on the current LFI schemes for Arm64 and x86-64.

A specification for untrusted LFI components is also in-progress. That
specification will describe the behavior of the LFI rewriter, which can be used
by compiler developers to produce programs that pass the LFI verifier.

# Acknowledgement

The Latex template used for this specification was adapted from the [Hare
language specification](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare-specification).
