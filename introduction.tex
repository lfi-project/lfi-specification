\specchapter{Introduction}

\specitem
This document specifies the behavior of an LFI system for a particular
architecture, describing the behavior of three components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The verifier: a program that reads a block of machine code, and
        returns either \textbf{accept} or \textbf{reject}.
    \item The assembler: a program that produces machine code from assembly
        source code.
    \item The runtime: a program that loads and executes programs, while
        maintaining their memory isolation. This document leaves the runtime
        component unspecified as much as possible to allow many possible
        implementations.
\end{enumerate}
